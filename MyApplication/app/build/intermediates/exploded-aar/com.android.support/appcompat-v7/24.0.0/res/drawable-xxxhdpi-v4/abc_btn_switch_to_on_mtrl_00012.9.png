The I/O package is not thread safe by default. In multithreaded applications, a stream must be accessed in a thread-safe way, such as a thread-safe wrapper returned by TextReader's or TextWriter's Synchronized methods. This also applies to classes like StreamWriter and StreamReader.GUnmanaged memory stream position was beyond the capacity of the stream.qInsufficient available memory to meet the expected demands of an operation at this time.  Please try again later.ÊInsufficient memory to meet the expected demands of an operation, and this system is likely to never satisfy this request with the current GC heap segment sizes.  If this is a 32 bit system, consider booting in 3 GB mode, or using a config file to tweak the segment sizes for the CLR's GC large object heap and normal object heap.¦Insufficient available memory to meet the expected demands of an operation at this time, possibly due to virtual address space fragmentation.
